# Dig-Inn
Dig Inn Data Analytics Project
The data is borrowed from Columbia Business School. 
In this project I:

•	Used Python (Numpy, Pandas) and R (Dplyr, Tidyverse) to clean and analyze more than 2 million rows of 
restaurant chain dataset
•	Utilized both R(GGplot2, Heatmap) and Python(Matplolib) to create meaningful visualizations and find patterns
•	Translated the statistical insights to technical & non-technical audiences

In this project, I with Jim:

1) Conducted Data Mining and Analysis for a Health Food Restaurant Chain:

Cleaned and analyzed a dataset containing over 2.5 million data points for a prominent New York City health food restaurant chain, "Dig Inn," encompassing sales, menu items, and restaurant locations.
Utilized R Studio and Python to clean, manipulate, and analyze the data, resulting in a unified dataset with 2.394 million data points and more than 30 unique variables.
Generated actionable insights, including identifying peak sales hours, popular dishes, delivery preferences by location, top-selling menu items, and the highest-grossing store location.

2)Contributed to Strategic Decision-Making:

Provided critical data-driven insights that influenced marketing and operational decisions for the health food restaurant chain.
Enhanced understanding of customer preferences, peak business hours, and menu item popularity to optimize sales strategies.

3)Mapped Customer Preferences by Location:

Incorporated demographic data to understand customer preferences by neighborhood, revealing insights such as delivery being favored in Upper East and Upper West Side, while dine-in was less preferred in the Upper East Side.
Identified unique dining behaviors in specific areas, such as the NYU branch's clientele showing a preference for in-store dining or pick-up due to its student population.
Contributed to the development of targeted marketing and service strategies tailored to different customer segments and locations.
